1. Tell me about yourself.
This question seems simple, so many people fail to prepare for it, but it’s crucial. Here's the deal: Don’t give your complete employment (or personal) history. Instead, give a pitch—one that’s concise and compelling and that shows exactly why you’re the right fit for the job. Muse writer and MIT career counselor Lily Zhang recommends using a present, past, future formula. Talk a little bit about your current role (including the scope and perhaps one big accomplishment), then give some background as to how you got there and experience you have that’s relevant. Finally, segue into why you want—and would be perfect for—this role.

What is the Meaning of Artifical Intelligence? Artificial intelligence is the means intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of Al include NLP,
speech recognition and machine vision. What is the Meaning of machine Learning? What is machine learning? Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, without human it will
solve problems. Why is it called deep learning? Deep Learning gets its name from the fact that it will test the images as well videos, it just changes the weights using an optimization function.
A Layer is a row of so-called "Neurons" in the middle. What is the difference between learning and deep learning? Machine learning and deep learning are both types of Al. In short, machine
learning is Al that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of
the human brain.
